In this article [in Dutch], we provide an accessible overview of newly developed ideas abouthow people with autism process information and deal with uncertainty based on thepredictive brain theory. Like Sherlock builds the plot of a murder to explain the tracesobserved at the scene of the crime and to predict new traces, the brain also builds amodel of our observations and how they are caused. That mental model is constantlyadjusted using prediction errors: the comparisons of the predictions that the modelgenerates and the actual incoming signals of our senses. However, not every predictionerror needs to be taken at face value, given that some errors are caused by noise or byvariability in sensory signals that does not matter (in a particular situation or task).Prediction errors must therefore be given a correct weight based on an estimate of theuncertainties in the sensory information for a given context. We explain the importanceof this for learning and understanding our (social) environment and how difficulties in
estimating the weight of prediction errors can lead to the symptoms and cognitiveprofile associated with autism.
