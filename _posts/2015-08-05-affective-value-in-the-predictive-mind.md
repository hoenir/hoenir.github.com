Although affective value is fundamental in explanations of behavior, it is still a somewhat alien concept in cognitive science. It implies a normativity or directionality that mere information processing models cannot seem to provide. In this paper we trace how value can emerge from information processing in the brain, as described by predictive processing. By articulating the grounding of predictive processing in homeostasis, we clarify what can count as relevant or valuable information and what implications this has for the concept of reward and affective valence. We propose that valence, a core component of all emotions, is a reflection of a specific aspect of predictive information processing, namely the dynamics in prediction errors across time and the predictions we, in turn, form about these dynamics. Emotions appear as the continuous non-conceptual feedback on evolving —increasing or decreasing— uncertainties relative to our predictions. The upshot of this view is that the various emotions, from "basic" ones to the non-typical ones such as humor, curiosity and aesthetic affects, can be shown to follow a single underlying logic. Our analysis takes several cues from existing emotion theories but deviates from them in revealing ways. The account on offer does not just specify the interactions between emotion and cognition, rather it entails a deep integration of the two.
