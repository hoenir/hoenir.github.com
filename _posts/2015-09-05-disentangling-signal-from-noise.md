Bayesian predictive coding is recently welcomed as a fruitful framework to understand various mental disorders. In this paper we try to demonstrate the potential of this framework for explaining autism spectrum disorders, with particular attention to the nuance it allows in comparison to previous cognitive accounts of autism. Starting from an account centered on deficient differential weighting of prediction errors (based in so-called precision estimation), we will see that individuals with autism particularly have difficulties separating signal from noise, across different tasks. We show that such a view goes beyond simplistic (increased) bottom-up or (weak) top-down theories of autism, and hence has unique testable predictions. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this deficit may connect to the neurogenetics and symptomatology of autism.
