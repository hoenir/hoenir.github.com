Iâ€™m a postdoc researcher of the Research Fund Flanders ([FWO](http://www.fwo.be)) in the Brain & Cognition Unit in [Leuven](http://maps.google.be/maps?q=Tiensestraat%20102,%203000%20Leuven&amp;hl=nl&amp;sll=50.877571,4.704328&amp;sspn=0.362637,0.617294&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;gl=be&amp;z=16), working on the [GestaltReVision](http://www.gestaltrevision.be) project. [Contact](mailto:sandervandecruys@gmail.com) me.

One of the reasons I get up in the morning (or rather: stay up late at night) is to gain fundamental insight in the sane and insane mind, and in the brain that realizes it. In my scientific work I'm guided by the view of the brain as a prediction engine, continuously and proactively anticipating incoming sensory inputs. I like how this view has deep consequences for the interplay between cognition and emotion. More on this in my academic [publications](/work/index.html).

My other, intersecting fascination is with internet technology and the new possibilities (and challenges) it holds in connecting people to each other and to useful, reliable information. I'm particularly interested in how humans interact with increasingly intelligent (so predictive) technology, and in how this interaction (re)ignites questions about what it means to be human. I love to write about these topics, both for laymen and expert audiences. My fallible efforts in doing so are recorded on these pages...
