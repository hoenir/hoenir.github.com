Iâ€™m a [FWO](http://www.fwo.be) postdoc researcher in the Brain & Cognition Unit in [Leuven](http://maps.google.be/maps?q=Tiensestraat%20102,%203000%20Leuven&amp;hl=nl&amp;sll=50.877571,4.704328&amp;sspn=0.362637,0.617294&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;gl=be&amp;z=16), working on the [GestaltReVision](http://www.gestaltrevision.be) project. [Contact](mailto:sandervandecruys@gmail.com) me.

One of the reasons I get up in the morning (or stay up late at night) is to gain fundamental insight in the sane and insane mind, and in the brain that realizes it. In my scientific work I'm guided by the view of the brain as a prediction engine, continuously and proactively anticipating incoming sensory inputs. My other, intersecting fascination is with internet technology and the new possibilities it provides in connecting people to each other and to accessible, reliable information. I'm particularly interested in how humans interact with increasingly intelligent (so predictive) technology, and in how this interaction (re)ignites questions about what it means to be human. I love to write about all these topics, both for laymen and expert audiences.
